# DeepLearning
This repository is for Deep learning projects

First DL project is using RESNET50 and perform transfer learning
Using RESNET50 to implement transfer learning to identify car brands based on the images given as inputs
As part of transfer learning, we use all the weights that are already available in the RESNET50 package. 
We just change the input layer and the output layer depending on our requirement
Also in my experiment i tried with 20 epochs and still were able to achieve good accuracy.
